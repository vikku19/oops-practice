What is this Project about?

You are tasked with creating the fundamental classes to represent the player character, that is, the entity within the game world that the user of the game software would control. A role-playing game or RPG is a game in which you take on the persona 
(somtimes also called the avatar) of an in-game character, who goes on quests, fight enemies, looks for gold, crawls through dungeons or 
any other number of tasks, depending on the game.
